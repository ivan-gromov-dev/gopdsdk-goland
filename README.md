# gopdsdk for GoLand

Thin GoLand integration for the `gopdsdk` analyzer. The plugin starts
`gopdsdk lsp` for Go files and lets the IntelliJ Platform render Playdate
diagnostics and safe actions alongside GoLand's normal Go support.

Analysis stays in the Go executable. The Kotlin client must not copy rule
logic, severity decisions, or edit generation from gopdsdk.

## Status

This repository contains a reproducible IntelliJ Platform plugin scaffold and a
minimal project-wide LSP integration. It currently expects `gopdsdk` on PATH.
Settings, executable compatibility checks, and Marketplace packaging are tracked
in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

## Requirements

- GoLand 2026.1.4 through 2026.2;
- JDK 21 for development (the Gradle wrapper can provision it automatically);
- `gopdsdk` with the `lsp` command on PATH.

## Development

```text
./gradlew runIde
./gradlew test
./gradlew buildPlugin
./gradlew verifyPlugin
```

The default build targets the oldest supported GoLand release. To exercise the
newest supported platform directly, run:

```text
./gradlew test -PplatformVersion=2026.2.0.1
```

`runIde` launches a sandboxed GoLand. Open a Go module that uses gopdsdk; the
native Language Services widget exposes server state and logs.

## Architecture

```text
GoLand Go files
    |-- bundled Go plugin  general Go language services
    `-- gopdsdk lsp       Playdate diagnostics and safe fixes
```

The plugin uses the native IntelliJ LSP client instead of embedding another
protocol implementation.
